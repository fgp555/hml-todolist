      <h1>About To-Do List App</h1>
      <p>
        The To-Do List app helps you stay organized and keep track of your daily tasks.
        You can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them as you go. This app
        uses your browser's local storage to save your tasks, so you can access them even
        after refreshing the page.
      </p>

      <h2>Features:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Add new tasks to your list.</li>
        <li>Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox.</li>
        <li>Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.</li>
        <li>Tasks are stored in your browser's local storage, so they persist between sessions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works:</h2>
      <p>
        The app relies on JavaScript to manage the tasks and local storage. When you add a task,
        it is saved to the local storage, and when you load the page again, the tasks are loaded
        from local storage. You can toggle completion status by clicking the checkbox next to each
        task, and delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to them.
      </p>

      <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS (with Pico CSS for styling)</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>LocalStorage API for saving tasks between sessions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About the Developer:</h2>
